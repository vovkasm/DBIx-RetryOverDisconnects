DBIx::RetryOverDisconnects - DBI wrapper that helps to deal with databases connection problems

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use DBIx::RetryOverDisconnects;
    my $dbh = DBIx::RetryOverDisconnects->connect($dsn, $user, $pass, {
        ReconnectRetries  => 5,
        ReconnectInterval => 1,
        ReconnectTimeout  => 3,
        TxnRetries        => 3,
    });

    #All of this 3 methods will be successfuly completed despite of
    #possible connection losses except for sql errors.
    $dbh->do("...");
    my $sth = $dbh->prepare("...");
    $sth->execute(...);

    #other functionality that DBI supports

    $dbh->begin_work;
    my $ok = eval {
        $dbh->do("...");
        #...code
        $dbh->do("...");
        $dbh->commit;
        1;
    };

    unless ($ok) {
        if ($dbh->is_trans_disconnect) {
            #connection to database has been lost during transaction
            #$dbh has been already reconnected to database as we felt here.
            #It is now safe to retry the transaction from the beginning.
        }
        elsif($dbh->is_fatal_disconnect) {
            #database is down and reconnect retries limit is reached
        }
        elsif($dbh->is_sql_error) {
            #all other DBI's errors that are not related to connection problems
            $dbh->rollback;
            #deal with sql error;
        }
    }

    #or simply run the perl code in transaction mode.
    $dbh->txn_do(sub {
        $dbh->do("...");
        #...code
        $dbh->do("...");
    });
    #successful completion is guaranteed except for sql or perl errors.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This wrapper intercepts all requests. If some request fails this module
detects the reason of fail. If the reason was database connection problem
then wrapper would automatically reconnect and restart the query. Otherwise
it would rethrow the exception.

If you are not in transaction then you can just do

    $dbh->do('...');
    $sth->execute(...);

This might have 2 fatal cases:

=over

=item *

SQL error (a good reason to die).

=item *

Reconnect retries limit reached (database is completely down or network failure).

=back

For example, if the connection to database were lost during 'execute' call, the module
would reconnect to database with a timeout 'ReconnectTimeout'. If reconnect failed it
would reconnect again 'ReconnectRetries' times with 'ReconnectInterval' interval
(in seconds). If reconnect retries limit was reached it would raise an error and
$dbh->is_fatal_disconnect would be true.

If you are in transaction then even DB disconnect will raise an error.
But you can check $dbh->is_trans_disconnect and restart the transaction if it is 'true'.
Other possible errors are the same: sql error and reconnect limit.

The recommended way of using transactions is

    $dbh->txn_do($code_ref);

because 'txn_do' would automatically restart the transaction if it was failed because
of database disconnect. The transaction can be restarted at most 'TxnRetries' times.
If 'TxnRetries' limit was reached then error would be raised and
$dbh->is_fatal_trans_disconnect set to true.
Other error cases are the same as above.

'txn_do' would try do to rollback if there was a perl or sql error (no rollback needed
when you loose connection to database: DB server already has done it).
Rollback is successul when $@ =~ /Rollback OK/;

Note: For the perfomance reasons, DBI attribute 'RaiseError' is always set to 'true'.

=head1 METHODS

=head1 Class methods

=head2 connect

    DBIx::RetryOverDisconnects->connect($dsn, $user, $pass, $attrs);

All parameters are passed directly to DBI.
Additional $attrs are

=over

=item *

ReconnectRetries - How many times DBIx::RetryOverDisconnects will try to reconnect
to database. Default to 5.

=item *

ReconnectInterval - Interval (in seconds) between reconnect attemps.
Default to 2.

=item *

ReconnectTimeout - Timeout (in seconds) for waiting the database to accept
connection (because sometimes DBI->connect can block your application).
Default to 5.

=item *

TxnRetries - How many times the wrapper would try to restart transaction if it was
failed because of database connection problems. Default to 4.

=head2 txn_do

    $dbh->txn_do($code_ref);

'txn_do' is able to die with one of the is_fatal_disconnect, is_sql_error,
is_fatal_trans_disconnect set to true.

In most cases you don't need to wrap it into 'eval' because all of this exceptions
are subject to die (database completely down, network down, bussiness logic error, etc).
